## Overview

I am thrilled to have finally traced the origin of this elegant piece of graphical mathematics introduced by Dr. Peng! This fragment, extracted from the paper **"Graphical Linear Algebra"** (arXiv:2105.06244), introduces a categorical framework for representing matrices and linear maps. It defines an equational theory, named $\mathbf{cb}_k$ (for *bicommutative bialgebra* structure with *scalars* over a ring $k$), which is proven to be a **presentation for the prop $\mathbf{Mat}_k$**—the prop of matrices over $k$ under the direct sum. Essentially, this work provides a rigorous and complete graphical calculus, where every linear algebra identity can be proven by diagrammatic manipulation. The accompanying website, [graphicallinearalgebra.net](https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/), serves as a comprehensive resource for this exciting categorical approach.

## Detailed Note on the Prop $\mathbf{cb}_k$

The fragment presents the foundational definition and proposition establishing the graphical calculus.

### I. Definition of the Prop $\mathbf{cb}_k$

**Original Text: Definition 1.1. [34, Defn. 3.4] Given a ring $k$, let $\mathbf{cb}_k$ denote the prop given by the generators ${}^1$:**

$$

**and the additional equations:**

$$

**Explanation of Generators:**

The prop $\mathbf{cb}_k$ is generated by a set of basic diagrammatic operations, which correspond to fundamental linear algebraic operations:

1.  **White Comonoid (Copying):** $\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{white_comonoid_copy.png}$ (Copy) and $\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{white_comonoid_unit.png}$ (Discard/Unit of Monoid). The white node represents the **comultiplication** ($\Delta: V \to V \otimes V$) and **counit** ($\epsilon: V \to k$) structures derived from the categorical *product* (direct sum). In the matrix context, this represents **copying a vector**.
2.  **Grey Monoid (Addition):** $\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{grey_monoid_add.png}$ (Add) and $\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{grey_monoid_unit.png}$ (Zero/Unit of Comonoid). The grey node represents the **multiplication** ($\mu: V \otimes V \to V$) and **unit** ($\eta: k \to V$) structures derived from the categorical *coproduct* (direct sum). This represents **adding two vectors** or inserting the **zero vector**.
3.  **Scalar Multiplication:** $\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{scalar_multiplication_a.png}$ (for all $a \in k$). This generator represents multiplication by a scalar $a \in k$ as a linear map $V \to V$.

**Explanation of Relations (Equations):**

The relations ensure that these generators behave like the operations of linear algebra:

1.  **Bicommutative Bialgebra Equations (White & Grey):**
    *   **Commutativity & Associativity (Monoid/Grey):** The grey node is an associative and commutative operation (addition). The two equations in the second line ensure the grey operation is associative and commutative.
    *   **Co-commutativity & Co-associativity (Comonoid/White):** The white node is a co-associative and co-commutative operation (copying). The first two equations in the top line ensure the white operation is co-associative and co-commutative.
    *   **Unit/Counit & Zero/Unit Laws:** The identity laws for the monoid/comonoid structures.
    *   **Bialgebra Law (Distributivity):** The key interaction relation: The second line, third equation (left to right), $\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{bialgebra_law_1.png}$, and its counterpart, $\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{bialgebra_law_2.png}$, express the distributive property relating the addition (grey) and copying (white) structures, ensuring the necessary compatibility for vector space structure (i.e., $\Delta$ and $\epsilon$ are algebra homomorphisms, and $\mu$ and $\eta$ are coalgebra homomorphisms). This is what makes it a *bicommutative bialgebra* (or *special Frobenius algebra*).

2.  **Additional Equations (Scalar Interaction):** These relations define how scalar multiplication interacts with the addition (grey) and copying (white) operations:
    *   The first three equations $\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{additional_eq_1_2_3.png}$ enforce linearity, ensuring that copying distributes over scalar multiplication, and that scaling a vector before copying is the same as copying then scaling both results.
    *   The final equations enforce the ring axioms:
        *   Multiplication composition: $\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{scalar_mult_composition.png}$ ensures $(a \circ b) = ab$ (ring multiplication).
        *   Unit element: $\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{scalar_unit_element.png}$ ensures the scalar $1$ is the identity map.
        *   Addition: $\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{scalar_addition_final.png}$ ensures $(a \oplus b) = a+b$ (ring addition, via the grey monoid).
        *   Zero element: $\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{scalar_zero_element.png}$ ensures the scalar $0$ is the additive identity.

### II. The Main Result

**Original Text: Proposition 1.2. [34, Prop. 3.9] Given a ring $k$, $\mathbf{cb}_k$ is a presentation for the prop $\mathbf{Mat}_k$, of matrices over $k$ under the direct sum.**

**Original Text: One should interpret the grey monoid as addition and the white comonoid as copying.**

This proposition is the central claim: the formal, diagrammatic system $\mathbf{cb}_k$ is *isomorphic* to the category of matrices over the ring $k$, where the categorical structure is defined by the **prop** $\mathbf{Mat}_k$.

**Concept: What is a Prop?**

A Prop (Product-and-Permutation Category) is a symmetric monoidal category where the objects are natural numbers (or objects indexed by natural numbers) and the monoidal product ($\otimes$) of objects is the categorical product (or coproduct).

*   **In $\mathbf{Mat}_k$:** The objects are free $k$-modules (or vector spaces, if $k$ is a field), $k^n$, indexed by $n \in \mathbb{N}$. The maps are $n \times m$ matrices over $k$. The monoidal product is the **direct sum** ($k^n \oplus k^m \cong k^{n+m}$).

The result means any matrix identity can be translated into a $\mathbf{cb}_k$ diagram, and any proof involving matrix manipulation can be carried out purely by applying the diagrammatic equations.

## Characteristics and Applicability of the $\mathbf{cb}_k$ Calculus

### 1. Characteristics of the Method

*   **Completeness:** The calculus is *complete* (Proposition 1.2), meaning the listed generators and relations are sufficient to derive *every* identity in linear algebra over a ring $k$.
*   **Equational/Diagrammatic Proofs:** Proofs are entirely diagrammatic and syntactic (like algebraic manipulation), removing the need to appeal to coordinates, basis vectors, or explicit matrix entries. This provides an *internal language* for linear algebra.
*   **Basis-Independent:** The calculus inherently works with linear maps without relying on a choice of basis until a specific matrix representation is required, aligning with the principles of categorical algebra.
*   **Focus on Structure:** It explicitly models the **additive structure** (grey monoid) and the **cloning/discarding structure** (white comonoid) and their required compatibility via the bicommutative bialgebra axioms.

### 2. Suitable Applications

This graphical calculus is particularly well-suited for problems involving:

*   **Tensor Products and Direct Sums:** The prop structure inherently handles the direct sum (as the monoidal product), and the diagrams simplify compositions of linear maps defined across complex tensor/direct sum structures.
*   **Categorical Abstraction:** It serves as a tool for abstracting linear algebra concepts to a categorical setting, which is useful in fields like categorical quantum mechanics and theoretical computer science.
*   **Simplifying Complex Proofs:** Identities involving the trace, transpose, and complex compositions (which can be cumbersome in coordinate notation) often become visually obvious and simpler to prove using the diagrammatic rewrite rules. For instance, the calculus is closely related to the **ZX-Calculus**, which is widely used for simplifying quantum circuit and quantum operation identities.
*   **General Rings:** The definition works over an arbitrary ring $k$, highlighting that the core algebraic structure of matrices holds beyond fields (vector spaces).
