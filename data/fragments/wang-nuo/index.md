## Overview

This content takes the form of an academic research record, proposing the existence of two novel substances (sildenofil and L-wzlteine) based on the "theories" of "professors" such as Zhao Mingyi, and studies their reaction process and the properties of the product under the action of a "strong antimony field". From a professional perspective, the involved chemical concepts (such as the combination mode of W+ ions, the naming of compounds) do not conform to the existing mainstream chemical system, and the "superchemistry" mentioned is not a recognized academic discipline. Combined with the subsequent note, it can be inferred that this is a humorous creation with a strong academic appearance, essentially using exaggerated and simulated chemical research expressions to tease the interesting interactions between male classmate Zhaoli Wang (the "W" in the substance corresponds to his surname Wang) and female classmate Nuo Chen (the "No" in the substance corresponds to her given name Nuo). 

**HINT**: The content below is a humorous academic-style creation, simulating chemical research to describe the interactions between two individuals. It is not based on real scientific principles or recognized academic disciplines. The figures (pic1 to pic6) correspond to pages 1 to 6 of the attached PDF file.

## 1. Proposed Existence of the Original Substances

Based on the viewpoint of Professor Zhao Mingyi, two specific substances with unique structures and properties are clearly considered to exist in the "superchemistry system". The relevant definitions and naming of the two substances are as follows:

### 1.1 Sildenofil

**Naming**: For the convenience of research and discussion, this substance is tentatively named sildenofil.

**Molecular Structure**: The core structure of the substance is shown in Figure 1 (pic1). From the structural sketch, it contains heterocyclic functional groups, aromatic ring systems and substituted amino groups, and the key characteristic is the introduction of tungsten (W) elements in the molecular skeleton, which forms a special chemical bond connection with the surrounding carbon (C) and oxygen (O) elements.

**Main Physical and Chemical Properties**: The basic physical and chemical parameters of sildenofil are shown in Figure 2 (pic2). According to the recorded data, the substance has a certain melting point range (specific values need to be determined by precise experiments), and shows relative stability under normal temperature and pressure. In terms of solubility, it has certain solubility in polar organic solvents, while its solubility in water is relatively low. In the aspect of chemical reactivity, it shows good reaction activity for nucleophilic substitution and addition reactions, especially the active sites connected with W elements are easy to undergo ligand exchange or bond breaking and recombination under specific conditions.

### 1.2 L-wzlteine

**Naming**: By analogy with the naming rule of natural amino acid L-cysteine, this substance is named L-wzlteine, emphasizing its structural similarity to L-cysteine and the chirality of the molecule (L-configuration).

**Molecular Structure**: The molecular structure is shown in Figure 3 (pic3). The molecule has a structure similar to that of amino acids, including amino group (-NH2), carboxyl group (-COOH) and a special side chain containing W+ ions. Under normal circumstances, the W+ ion in the molecule exists in an ionic state and forms an ionic bond with the O- ion generated by the dissociation of the adjacent hydroxyl group; however, according to the theory of Professor Tu Xiaohui, a famous superchemist, under the action of a strong antimony field, the chemical environment of W+ will change significantly: W+ will break the original ionic bond and form a covalent bond with the carbon atom at the upper left of the molecule, while the originally combined O- will combine with a hydrogen proton (H+) to form a hydroxyl group, and finally a carboxyl group is formed at the lower right end of the molecule through electron rearrangement. This structural transformation makes L-wzlteine show chemical properties highly similar to L-cysteine, such as amphotericity (can react with both acids and bases) and the ability to form disulfide bonds-like cross-linking structures.

**Main Physical and Chemical Properties**: The detailed physical and chemical properties of L-wzlteine are shown in Figure 4 (pic4). The substance is a white crystalline solid with a melting point of about 190-195℃ (decomposition). It is easily soluble in aqueous solutions with pH 5-7, and the aqueous solution shows weak acidity (pH≈5.2). In terms of mutagenicity, preliminary screening experiments show that it has no obvious mutagenic activity under normal conditions. The acute toxicity data show that the oral LDLo (lowest lethal dose) of unreported mice is 9mg/kg, and the oral LD50 (median lethal dose) of rats needs to be supplemented by further experiments.

## 2. Synthesis of the Novel Tungsten-Containing Organic Compound

It is a well-known chemical fact that sildenafil (a commercial drug, different from the "sildenofil" in this study) and L-cysteine can undergo amidation reaction under certain conditions. Based on this, Professor Zhou Jiechang, an organic chemist in the "superchemistry field", proposed that under the specific condition of a strong antimony field, the structurally similar sildenofil and L-wzlteine can also undergo a similar addition-elimination reaction to generate a new tungsten-containing organic compound.

### 2.1 Reaction Conditions and Process

**Reaction Catalyst and Medium**: The reaction takes high-purity antimony (Sb) powder as the "field source" to construct a strong antimony field environment, with anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the reaction solvent, and triethylamine (Et3N) as the acid-binding agent to maintain the alkaline environment of the reaction system (pH=8.5-9.0).

**Reaction Temperature and Time**: The reaction is carried out under reflux conditions, the temperature is controlled at 110-120℃, and the reaction duration is 8-10 hours. During the reaction process, thin-layer chromatography (TLC) is used for real-time monitoring, with ethyl acetate:petroleum ether=3:1 (v/v) as the developing solvent, and the reaction endpoint is determined when the spot of the raw material sildenofil completely disappears.

**Reaction Mechanism**: Under the action of a strong antimony field, the W+ ion in L-wzlteine undergoes orbital hybridization transformation (from sp3 to sp2 hybridization), which enhances the electrophilicity of the adjacent carbonyl carbon. The amino group in the sildenofil molecule acts as a nucleophile to attack the electrophilic carbonyl carbon, and after proton transfer and elimination of a molecule of water, a stable amide bond is formed, thereby generating the target product.

### 2.2 Product Structure and Naming

**Molecular Structure**: The chemical structure of the reaction product is shown in Figure 5 (pic5). The molecule integrates the structural fragments of sildenofil and L-wzlteine, with a molecular formula of C22H25N6O5W (tentative). The core structure is composed of a pyrazolopyrimidine heterocyclic ring, a methoxyphenyl group, an aminopropanoyloxy group and a tungsten-oxygen linkage system, forming a complex but stable organic-inorganic hybrid molecule.

**IUPAC Naming**: According to the IUPAC naming rules for organic compounds (simulated and extended in the "superchemistry system"), the systematic name of the product is **2-aminopropanoyloxy-[[4-methoxy-3-(1-methyl-3-oxo-7H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-6-yl)phenyl]amino]oxytungsten**.

## 3. Properties and Significance of the Reaction Product

### 3.1 Key Properties of the Product

The physical and chemical properties, toxicological data and drug-likeness evaluation of the novel tungsten-containing organic compound are shown in Figure 6 (pic6). The main characteristics are summarized as follows:

- **Physical State and Stability**: It is a light yellow powdery solid, insoluble in water and petroleum ether, soluble in DMSO and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). It is stable when stored in a dry and dark environment at room temperature, and decomposes when heated to above 230℃.

- **Toxicological Characteristics**: Acute toxicity tests show that the oral LD50 of guinea pigs is greater than 500mg/kg, belonging to low-toxic substances; the unreported oral LD50 of rats and mice needs to be supplemented by long-term experiments. Skin irritation tests show no obvious irritating effect on rabbit skin.

- **Ion Bonding Characteristics**: A key discovery in the study is that when the product is separated from the strong antimony field environment, the W+ ion and the No group (a special functional group in the molecule) are stably present in the same structural segment, and the W+ ion completely breaks away from the original C3H6NO2 group in L-wzlteine. This phenomenon indicates that there is a strong interaction force between the W element and the No group, and the binding stability is far higher than that between W+ and the original C3H6NO2 group, showing the relative "disadvantage" of W in the competitive combination.

### 3.2 Academic Significance (Simulated Expression)

The study believes that this discovery has "great academic value" in the "superchemistry field": it reveals the intricate chemical connection between the W element and the No group at the molecular level, and confirms that the reaction between the two can be carried out under the premise of forming stable organic compounds. This not only enriches the types of tungsten-containing organic compounds in the "superchemistry system", but also provides a new research idea for exploring the interaction mechanism between metal elements and special functional groups under extreme conditions (strong antimony field). I humorously claimed that "this achievement is worthy of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry".
