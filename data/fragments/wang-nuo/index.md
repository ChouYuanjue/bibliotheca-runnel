## Overview

It is necessary to first clarify that the so-called "scholars" such as Zhao Mingyi mentioned in this record are well-known online pseudo-scientists, whose absurd theories are often ridiculed by the academic community and netizens. The bizarre terms involved in this text, such as "superchemistry", are all their "masterpieces" that deviate from scientific common sense. In this research record, I propose the existence of two novel substances, "sildenofil" and "L-wzlteine", based on the theories put forward by these pseudo-scientists including Zhao Mingyi. I then systematically investigate their reaction process and the properties of the resulting product under the action of a "strong antimony field". From a professional chemical perspective, the core concepts involved—such as the bonding modes of W⁺ ions and the compound naming logic—do not align with mainstream chemical systems, and "superchemistry" is not a recognized academic discipline. As implied later, this work employs exaggerated chemical research expressions to metaphorically depict the interesting interactions between my classmates: male classmate Zhaoli Wang (where the "W" in the substances corresponds to his surname "Wang") and female classmate Nuo Chen (where the "No" in the substances corresponds to her given name "Nuo").

## 1. Proposed Existence of the Original Substances

Within the "superchemistry system", and based on the viewpoints of Professor Zhao Mingyi, I have clearly identified the existence of two specific substances with unique structures and properties. Their relevant definitions and naming conventions are elaborated as follows:

### 1.1 Sildenofil

**Naming**: For the convenience of my research and discussion, I have tentatively named this substance "sildenofil". It is important to emphasize that this substance is distinct from the commercially available drug sildenafil, despite the similar nomenclature.

**Molecular Structure**: The core structure of this substance is presented in Figure 1 (pic1). From the structural diagram, the molecule contains heterocyclic functional groups, aromatic ring systems, and substituted amino groups. A key feature is the incorporation of a tungsten (W) element in its molecular skeleton, which forms special chemical bonds with the surrounding carbon (C) and oxygen (O) elements—though this bonding mode currently lacks support from mainstream chemical bond theory.

**Main Physical and Chemical Properties**: The basic physical and chemical parameters of sildenofil are shown in Figure 2 (pic2). According to the data I have recorded, the substance exhibits a specific melting point range (with precise values to be determined through subsequent experiments). It maintains relative stability under normal temperature and pressure conditions. In terms of solubility, it demonstrates moderate solubility in polar organic solvents but low solubility in water. Chemically, it shows good reactivity in nucleophilic substitution and addition reactions; particularly, the active sites connected to the W element are prone to ligand exchange or bond rearrangement under specific conditions.

### 1.2 L-wzlteine

**Naming**: By analogy with the naming rules of the natural amino acid L-cysteine, I have named this substance "L-wzlteine". This naming approach emphasizes its structural similarity to L-cysteine and the assumed L-configuration chirality of the molecule.

**Molecular Structure**: The molecular structure of this substance is illustrated in Figure 3 (pic3). It possesses an amino acid-like structure, including -NH₂, -COOH groups, and a special side chain containing W⁺ ions. Under normal conditions, the W⁺ ion exists in an ionic state, forming an ionic bond with the O⁻ ion generated by the dissociation of adjacent hydroxyl groups. However, according to the theory proposed by the renowned superchemist Professor Tu Xiaohui, a "strong antimony field" induces significant changes: the W⁺ ion breaks the original ionic bond and forms a covalent bond with the carbon atom at the upper left of the molecule. The previously bonded O⁻ then combines with an H⁺ proton to form a hydroxyl group, and electron rearrangement ultimately leads to the formation of a carboxyl group at the lower right end of the molecule. This structural transformation endows L-wzlteine with chemical properties highly similar to L-cysteine, such as amphotericity (capable of reacting with both acids and bases) and the ability to form disulfide bond-like cross-linking structures.

**Main Physical and Chemical Properties**: The detailed physical and chemical properties of L-wzlteine are presented in Figure 4 (pic4). Based on my observations, the substance appears as a white crystalline solid with a melting point of approximately 190-195℃ (accompanied by decomposition). It is readily soluble in aqueous solutions with a pH range of 5-7, and the resulting aqueous solution exhibits weak acidity (pH≈5.2). Preliminary screening experiments indicate that it has no obvious mutagenic activity under normal conditions. Acute toxicity data shows that the unreported oral LDLo (lowest lethal dose) in mice is 9mg/kg, while the oral LD50 (median lethal dose) in rats remains to be supplemented through further experimental studies.

## 2. Synthesis of the Novel Tungsten-Containing Organic Compound

It is a well-established chemical fact that sildenafil (the commercial drug, distinct from the "sildenofil" investigated in this study) and L-cysteine can undergo amidation reactions under certain conditions. Building on this, Professor Zhou Jiechang, an organic chemist in the field of superchemistry, has proposed that under the specific condition of a "strong antimony field", the structurally analogous sildenofil and L-wzlteine can also undergo a similar addition-elimination reaction to generate a new tungsten-containing organic compound. In this work, I have systematically organized the relevant hypothetical reaction conditions and processes as follows:

### 2.1 Reaction Conditions and Process

**Reaction Catalyst and Medium**: In my experimental design, high-purity antimony (Sb) powder serves as the "field source" to construct a simulated "strong antimony field" environment. Anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is used as the reaction solvent, and triethylamine (Et₃N) acts as an acid-binding agent to maintain the reaction system at a pH range of 8.5-9.0.

**Reaction Temperature and Time**: I conducted the reaction under reflux conditions at 110-120℃ for 8-10 hours. During the reaction process, I performed real-time monitoring using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) with ethyl acetate:petroleum ether=3:1 (v/v) as the developing solvent. I determined the reaction endpoint when the sildenofil raw material spot completely disappeared.

**Reaction Mechanism**: My proposed mechanism suggests that under the "strong antimony field", the W⁺ ion in L-wzlteine undergoes hybridization transformation from sp³ to sp², which enhances the electrophilicity of the adjacent carbonyl carbon. The amino group in sildenofil then acts as a nucleophile to attack this electrophilic carbon. Subsequent proton transfer and water elimination result in the formation of a stable amide bond, thereby generating the target product—though this mechanism currently lacks support from established organic reaction theory.

### 2.2 Product Structure and Naming

**Molecular Structure**: The chemical structure of the reaction product is shown in Figure 5 (pic5). Through structural analysis, I confirmed that the molecule integrates structural fragments of both sildenofil and L-wzlteine, with a tentative molecular formula of C₂₂H₂₅N₆O₅W. Its core structure consists of a pyrazolopyrimidine heterocycle, a methoxyphenyl group, an aminopropanoyloxy group, and a tungsten-oxygen linkage system, forming a complex yet stably structured organic-inorganic hybrid molecule.

**IUPAC Naming**: Referencing IUPAC naming rules and the specific settings of the "superchemistry" system, I have assigned the product the tentative systematic name "2-aminopropanoyloxy-[[4-methoxy-3-(1-methyl-3-oxo-7H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-6-yl)phenyl]amino]oxytungsten"—an extended designation that does not conform to standard IUPAC specifications.

## 3. Properties and Significance of the Reaction Product

### 3.1 Key Properties of the Product

The physical and chemical properties, toxicological data, and drug-likeness evaluation of the novel tungsten-containing organic compound are summarized in Figure 6 (pic6). Based on my comprehensive analysis, its main characteristics are as follows:

**Physical State and Stability**: I observed the product as a light yellow powdery solid. It is insoluble in water and petroleum ether but soluble in DMSO and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). The substance remains stable when stored in dry, dark conditions at room temperature and decomposes when heated above 230℃.

**Toxicological Characteristics**: My simulated acute toxicity tests classify the product as low-toxic, with a guinea pig oral LD50 > 500mg/kg. Oral LD50 data for rats and mice are currently unreported and require further experimental verification. Additionally, simulated skin irritation tests showed no obvious irritant effects on rabbit skin.

**Ion Bonding Characteristics**: A key finding from my study is that when the product is removed from the "strong antimony field" environment, the W⁺ ion stably coexists with the "No group" (a specially identified functional group) in the same structural segment, completely dissociating from the original C₃H₆NO₂ group of L-wzlteine. This phenomenon indicates that the interaction between the W element and the "No group" is significantly stronger than that between W⁺ and the C₃H₆NO₂ group, reflecting the relative "disadvantage" of W in competitive bonding—a core metaphorical observation regarding the interactions between the two classmates.

### 3.2 Academic Significance (Simulated Expression)

Within the framework of the "superchemistry field", I contend that this study holds significant academic value: it reveals the intricate molecular interactions between the W element and the "No group", confirming the feasibility of forming stable organic compounds through their reaction. This discovery enriches the diversity of hypothetical tungsten-containing compounds and provides a new research direction for exploring the interaction mechanisms between metal elements and special functional groups under extreme conditions. I humorously propose that "this achievement is worthy of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry"—a lighthearted assertion unrelated to actual academic evaluation standards.
