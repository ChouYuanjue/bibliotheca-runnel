    "content": "## Overview\n\nThis content takes the form of a geometric theory construction record, proposing the core axiom of \"Chunpinative Geometry\" (Chunping Geometry), and defines related concepts such as \"Chunpinative Space\" (Chunping Space) and \"Chunpinatively Measurable\" on this basis, and puts forward preliminary properties and lemmas. From the perspective of mainstream geometry, the core axiom \"the corner is equal to the supplementary angle\" breaks the basic logical relationship of angles in Euclidean geometry and non-Euclidean geometry, and the related property descriptions lack strict mathematical derivation support. Combined with the subsequent note, it can be inferred that this is a humorous mathematical theory simulation, essentially using the form of geometric axiom system construction to tease the user's junior high school math teacher Chunping Ding (the \"Chunpinative\" in the theory name corresponds to the teacher's given name \"Chunping\") and classmate CZL (the proposer of the lemma in the content).\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Axiom and Basic Definition of Chunpinative Geometry\n\n### 1.1 Foundational Axiom: D-C-P Axiom\n\nThe core axiom of Chunpinative Geometry, referred to as the D-C-P Axiom, is clearly defined as: **\"The corner is equal to its supplementary angle\"**. In the context of this axiom, the \"corner\" refers to the angle formed by two intersecting line segments or rays in the geometric space, and the \"supplementary angle\" refers to the angle whose sum with the original angle is \\(180^\\circ\\). This axiom breaks the constraint that \"the supplementary angle of an angle is equal to \\(180^\\circ\\) minus the original angle\" in traditional geometry, and establishes a direct equivalence relationship between the angle and its supplementary angle, which is the logical starting point for constructing the entire Chunpinative Geometry system.\n\n### 1.2 Definition of Core Geometric Space: Chunpinative Space\n\n**1.2.1 Formal Definition**: A geometric space that satisfies the D-C-P Axiom (i.e., in this space, any corner is equal to its supplementary angle) is formally named **Chunpinative Space**. The theoretical system that studies the measure of general sets on Chunpinative Space is collectively called **Chunpinative Geometry**. The naming of the space and the geometry system is intended to highlight the core position of the axiom in the entire theory and carry the corresponding commemorative or humorous connotation.\n\n**1.2.2 Scope of Application Note**: The initial definition of Chunpinative Space is based on the general geometric framework. For special cases such as zero-dimensional space, one-dimensional space, and discrete space, it needs to be further supplemented and restricted in the follow-up expansion of the theory, and the relevant content will be discussed in the subsequent detailed research.\n\n### 1.3 Preliminary Properties of Chunpinative Space\n\nBased on the D-C-P Axiom and the definition of Chunpinative Space, the following preliminary properties (1.2.1 Properties) can be derived, which lay the foundation for the further study of the space structure:\n\n- **Property i (Space Carrier)**: A general Chunpinative Space is defined on the Cartesian product \\(X \\times Y\\), where \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are non-empty sets (usually number sets or point sets in traditional geometry). This means that the elements (points) in the space can be represented by ordered pairs \\((x, y)\\) where \\(x \\in X\\) and \\(y \\in Y\\), which provides a coordinate representation basis for the analytical study of the space. The specific forms of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) (such as real number sets, integer sets, etc.) will be determined according to the specific research objects of the space.\n\n- **Property ii (Algebraic Structure)**: Chunpinative Space is an Abelian space (commutative space), which means that for the defined binary operation (such as the addition operation of vectors or points in the space), the commutative law holds, i.e., for any two elements \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the space, \\(a + b = b + a\\). However, the space is not closed under addition, that is, the result of adding two elements in the space may not belong to the space itself. The proof of this property is regarded as an exercise for further exploration, and the core of the proof lies in constructing counterexamples based on the D-C-P Axiom.\n\n- **Property iii (Rigidity)**: Any Chunpinative Space is rigid, which is mainly reflected in its non-deformability. In traditional geometry, \"rigidity\" usually refers to the property that the shape and size of a geometric figure remain unchanged when it is subjected to external forces. In Chunpinative Space, this rigidity is derived from the uniqueness of the angle relationship determined by the D-C-P Axiom—since the angle and its supplementary angle are equal, the angle size is uniquely determined (equal to \\(90^\\circ\\) in the case of real number angles), which makes the relative position relationship between the line segments or planes in the space fixed and cannot be deformed arbitrarily. The verification of this property can be realized by constructing a specific Chunpinative Space (such as the space mentioned in Lemma 1.3) and analyzing its structural invariance.\n\n### 1.4 Key Lemma: CZL Lemma (by Cui Ziling)\n\n**Lemma Statement (1.3 Lemma)**: There exists a Chunpinative Space in which a right triangle with a vertex angle of \\(100^\\circ\\) can exist. This lemma is proposed by classmate CZL (Cui Ziling) and is therefore named the CZL Lemma. It is a key breakthrough in the study of the specific structure of Chunpinative Space, proving the existence of special Chunpinative Spaces that differ from traditional geometric spaces.\n\n**Relationship with General Space**: It is obvious that the Chunpinative Space mentioned in Lemma 1.3 is a special case of the general Chunpinative Space defined in Property i (1.2.1 i). The general space is defined on \\(X \\times Y\\), while the space in the lemma is a specific form of \\(X \\times Y\\) with restricted \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), which is a concrete manifestation of the general space under specific conditions.\n\n### 1.5 Construction Method of Special Chunpinative Space\n\nTo construct the special Chunpinative Space that satisfies the CZL Lemma (i.e., the space where a right triangle with a vertex angle of \\(100^\\circ\\) exists), the method of analytic continuation of the entire space must be adopted. Analytic continuation is a common method in mathematical analysis, which extends the definition domain of a function or the scope of a space while maintaining certain analytical properties. In the construction of Chunpinative Space, this method is used to break the constraints of traditional Cartesian product \\(X \\times Y\\) and expand the space structure.\n\nSpecifically, the analytic continuation transforms the original space into a mapping from \\(X \\times Y\\) to \\(\\xi(X \\times Y)\\), where \\(\\xi\\) is the expanded space after continuation. In the case of no ambiguity, this type of space obtained by continuation is referred to as \\(\\xi\\) for short. The core of the mapping is to redefine the angle measurement rule in the space based on the D-C-P Axiom, so that the \"right triangle\" in the space no longer follows the angle sum theorem of triangles in Euclidean geometry, thereby realizing the existence of a right triangle with a vertex angle of \\(100^\\circ\\).\n\n### 1.6 Definition of Chunpinatively Measurable Space\n\n**Formal Definition (1.4 Definition)**: Let \\(\\xi\\) be a non-empty Chunpinative Space obtained by analytic continuation (\\(\\xi \\neq \\emptyset\\)), and let \\(R\\) be a \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra composed of some subsets of \\(\\xi\\). Then the binary group \\((\\xi, R)\\) is called a **Chunpinatively Measurable** space. Among them, the \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra \\(R\\) satisfies three conditions: 1. The entire space \\(\\xi \\in R\\); 2. If \\(A \\in R\\), then the complement of \\(A\\) (\\(\\xi \\setminus A\\)) \\(\\in R\\); 3. For any countable sequence of sets \\(A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_n, \\dots \\in R\\), their union \\(\\bigcup A_n \\in R\\). The definition of \\(\\sigma\\)-algebra provides a mathematical basis for the definition of measure on Chunpinative Space, which is the premise of studying the measure of general sets on the space.\n\n## 2. Supplementary Note on Chunpinative Geometry\n\nIt should be noted that the above content is only the initial attempt of the construction of Chunpinative Geometry, and there may be problems such as incomplete logical derivation and unclear concept definition. The core purpose is to use the form of geometric theory to carry out humorous expression. The later complete and self-consistent version of Chunpinative Geometry has been improved and sorted out, and can be viewed through the link: [https://www.runnelzhang.com/achieved/paper-cpg](https://www.runnelzhang.com/achieved/paper-cpg). The improved version will supplement the strict proof of the lemma, the detailed definition of the space operation, and the specific form of the measure, making the entire theory more rigorous and self-consistent."

    "content": "## Overview\n\n**The \"Fun Person\" of the Day:** Prof. Saburou Saitoh (Gunma University).\n\n**The Phenomenon:** A legitimate mathematician with a background in Reproducing Kernels who has seemingly pivoted his entire career toward proving that $z/0 = 0$.\n\nThis isn't your standard crankery. Saitoh isn't an outsider scribbling in green ink; he publishes via SCIRP (a known quantity in the predatory/low-tier world) and viXra, yet somehow managed to slip his \"Division by Zero\" manifesto into a Springer proceeding. This puts him in a league comparable to the late Myron W. Evans—academic credentials used to push a theory that breaks fundamental axioms.\n\n**Speculation on Intent:**\n\nIs this an elaborate academic troll? Unlikely. The tone is far too earnest. It appears to be a classic case of the \"Golden Hammer.\" Saitoh seems to have taken the concept of the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse (where the \"inverse\" of a zero matrix can be defined as zero) or Tikhonov regularization and elevated it from a computational tool to a fundamental law of the universe. By declaring that singularities are simply \"zero,\" he eliminates all poles, singularities, and infinities. It is a \"brute force\" solution to complex analysis: if a function blows up, just define it as zero. The result is a mathematical system where the point at infinity collapses into the origin—a topological nightmare presented as \"elementary and fundamental mathematics.\"\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Analysis of the Texts\n\n### I. The Manifesto: *Matrices and Division by Zero z/0 = 0*\n\n**Source:** Matsuura, T. and Saitoh, S. (2016). Matrices and Division by Zero z/0 = 0. *Advances in Linear Algebra & Matrix Theory*, 6, 51-58. [https://doi.org/10.4236/alamt.2016.62007](https://doi.org/10.4236/alamt.2016.62007)\n\nThis paper lays the groundwork for the \"Yamada Field\" (Y-Field), a structure where division by zero is permitted and defined as zero.\n\n- **The Core Axiom:** Saitoh asserts that for any complex number $b$, the fraction $b/0 = 0$. This is justified \"incidentally\" by Tikhonov regularization.\n\n- **The Geometric Consequence (The Collapse):**In standard geometry, parallel lines meet at infinity.\n\n- In Saitoh’s geometry, the \"point at infinity\" is represented by $z=0$.\n\n- Therefore, **parallel lines intersect at the origin $(0,0)$.**\n\n- *Critique:* This implies that if you have two parallel lines anywhere in space, their intersection point is the origin. The logic effectively folds the entire Euclidean plane such that the \"horizon\" touches the center.\n\n**Cramer's Law \"Fix\":**Standard Cramer's Law fails when the determinant is zero ($D=0$, singular matrix). Saitoh claims that by defining $z/0=0$, the solution to a system with a singular matrix is simply the zero vector.\"By the division by zero, we can understand that if $a_1b_2 - a_2b_1 = 0$, then the common point is always given by $(0,0)$ even when the two lines are the same.\"\n\n**Physical Interpretations:Hooke's Law:** For springs in series $\\frac{1}{k} = \\frac{1}{k_1} + \\frac{1}{k_2}$. If $k_1=0$, normally the system breaks. Saitoh argues $1/0 = 0$, so $1/k = 1/k_2$, meaning $k=k_2$.\n\n**Einstein Misquote:** He invokes Einstein to support his theory, though the quote is likely apocryphal or misinterpreted.\n            \"Blackholes are where God divided by zero.\"\n\n### II. The Escalation: *log 0 = log ∞ = 0 and Applications*\n\n**Source:** Michiwaki, H., Matuura, T., Saitoh, S. (2018). $\\log 0 = \\log \\infty = 0$ and Applications. In: Pinelas, S., Caraballo, T., Kloeden, P., Graef, J. (eds) *Differential and Difference Equations with Applications*. ICDDEA 2017. Springer Proceedings in Mathematics & Statistics, vol 230. Springer, Cham. [https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-75647-9_24](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-75647-9_24)\n\n\nHere, the theory expands to logarithmic functions and complex analysis, creating even more startling discontinuities.\n\n- **Redefining Logarithms:** Since $\\log(z)$ has a singularity at $z=0$ and a pole at $z=\\infty$, and since the \"point at infinity\" is now the \"origin\" (via $1/0=0$), Saitoh concludes:\"In this paper, we will show that $\\log 0 = \\log \\infty = 0$ by the division by zero $z/0 = 0$.\"\n\n- **The $1/z$ Mapping:** He relies heavily on the mapping $W = 1/z$. In standard analysis, $z \\to 0$ implies $W \\to \\infty$. Saitoh argues that the image of $z=0$ is exactly $W=0$.\"The image of $z = 0$ is $W = 0$ (should be defined)... The division by zero will give great impacts to complex analysis and to our ideas for the space and universe.\"\n\n- **Schrödinger's Euler Identity:** This leads to bizarre multivalued definitions.$e^0 = 1$ (standard definition).\n\n- $e^0 = 0$ (via the \"division by zero\" logic where the value at a singularity is zero).\n\nHe acknowledges this \"strong discontinuity\" but accepts it as a \"natural way\" the universe works.\n\n**Applications to Differential Equations:** He solves differential equations by simply ignoring the singular parts. If a term contains a $1/x$ and $x=0$, that term vanishes.\"For the differential equation... we have the solution... Then, if $\\mu = 0$, we obtain, immediately, by the division by zero [a solution where the singular term vanishes].\"\n\n**The \"Zero\" Constant:** He posits that $0^0 = 1$ is convenient for Taylor series, but $0^0 = 0$ is also valid depending on context. He also claims $\\cos 0 = 1$ and $\\cos 0 = 0$ are both \"valid\" in different contexts (reflection of infinity to the origin).\n\n## Selected Quotes\n\n- **On the ambition of the project:** \"The division by zero has a long and mysterious story over the world... however, Sin-Ei Takahasi established a simple and decisive interpretation.\"\n\n- **On the redefinition of infinity:** \"The point at infinity is represented by zero, that is, the coincidence of the point at infinity and the origin.\"\n\n- **On the \"Zero\" value of functions:** \"We wish to consider also the value $\\cos 0 = 0$. The values $e^0 = 0$ and $\\cos 0 = 0$ may be considered that the values at the point at infinity are reflected to the origin.\"\n\n## A Serious Critique\n\nMathematics, as a deductive system, stands on the bedrock of consistent axioms—propositions whose truth is assumed to build coherent, predictive, and applicable frameworks. To redefine a foundational operation like division by zero is not an act of \"revolutionary insight,\" but a violation of this coherence, as Saitoh’s work demonstrates through its cascading logical contradictions and detachment from both theoretical rigor and empirical reality.\n\nThe core flaw of Saitoh’s theory lies in its confusion of *computational convenience* with *ontological truth*. Tools like the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse or Tikhonov regularization are valuable precisely because they are *contextual*: they resolve ambiguities in specific computational tasks (e.g., solving underdetermined systems) while acknowledging their status as practical adaptations, not universal laws. By elevating these tools to axiomatic status, Saitoh erases the distinction between \"what works for a problem\" and \"what is true of the mathematical structure itself.\" The result is not a \"new field\" but a house of cards: parallel lines intersecting at the origin dismantles Euclidean geometry, conflicting values of $e^0$ and $\\cos 0$ render analysis meaningless, and \"solving\" differential equations by ignoring singularities abandons the very purpose of such equations—to model continuous change accurately.\n\nEqually troubling is the way Saitoh’s academic credentials have lent a veneer of legitimacy to a theory that would otherwise be dismissed. His ability to publish in a Springer proceeding—an imprint associated with rigorous peer review—raises critical questions about the integrity of academic publishing, particularly in specialized fields where gatekeeping relies on expert familiarity with niche topics. This is not a trivial concern: bad mathematics, when cloaked in academic authority, can mislead early-career researchers, waste resources on unfruitful inquiries, and erode public trust in the discipline’s ability to distinguish fact from fancy.\n\nTo be clear, academic progress often emerges from challenging orthodoxy—but meaningful challenges adhere to a basic contract: they either show the existing framework is incomplete (e.g., non-Euclidean geometry extending, not rejecting, Euclid’s axioms) or propose a new system that is *more* consistent and explanatory than the old. Saitoh’s work does neither. It replaces a coherent system with one that is deliberately contradictory, then claims this contradiction as a \"natural\" feature of the universe—a rhetorical sleight of hand."

    "content": "## Overview\r\n\r\nThis content takes the form of an academic research record, proposing the existence of two novel substances (sildenofil and L-wzlteine) based on the \"theories\" of \"professors\" such as Zhao Mingyi, and studies their reaction process and the properties of the product under the action of a \"strong antimony field\". From a professional perspective, the involved chemical concepts (such as the combination mode of W+ ions, the naming of compounds) do not conform to the existing mainstream chemical system, and the \"superchemistry\" mentioned is not a recognized academic discipline. Combined with the subsequent note, it can be inferred that this is a humorous creation with a strong academic appearance, essentially using exaggerated and simulated chemical research expressions to tease the interesting interactions between male classmate Zhaoli Wang (the \"W\" in the substance corresponds to his surname Wang) and female classmate Nuo Chen (the \"No\" in the substance corresponds to her given name Nuo). \r\n\r\n**HINT**: The content below is a humorous academic-style creation, simulating chemical research to describe the interactions between two individuals. It is not based on real scientific principles or recognized academic disciplines. The figures (pic1 to pic6) correspond to pages 1 to 6 of the attached PDF file.\r\n\r\n[PDF OF FIGURES](/fragments/wang-nuo/pics.pdf)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 1. Proposed Existence of the Original Substances\r\n\r\nBased on the viewpoint of Professor Zhao Mingyi, two specific substances with unique structures and properties are clearly considered to exist in the \"superchemistry system\". The relevant definitions and naming of the two substances are as follows:\r\n\r\n### 1.1 Sildenofil\r\n\r\n**Naming**: For the convenience of research and discussion, this substance is tentatively named sildenofil.\r\n\r\n**Molecular Structure**: The core structure of the substance is shown in Figure 1 (pic1). From the structural sketch, it contains heterocyclic functional groups, aromatic ring systems and substituted amino groups, and the key characteristic is the introduction of tungsten (W) elements in the molecular skeleton, which forms a special chemical bond connection with the surrounding carbon (C) and oxygen (O) elements.\r\n\r\n**Main Physical and Chemical Properties**: The basic physical and chemical parameters of sildenofil are shown in Figure 2 (pic2). According to the recorded data, the substance has a certain melting point range (specific values need to be determined by precise experiments), and shows relative stability under normal temperature and pressure. In terms of solubility, it has certain solubility in polar organic solvents, while its solubility in water is relatively low. In the aspect of chemical reactivity, it shows good reaction activity for nucleophilic substitution and addition reactions, especially the active sites connected with W elements are easy to undergo ligand exchange or bond breaking and recombination under specific conditions.\r\n\r\n### 1.2 L-wzlteine\r\n\r\n**Naming**: By analogy with the naming rule of natural amino acid L-cysteine, this substance is named L-wzlteine, emphasizing its structural similarity to L-cysteine and the chirality of the molecule (L-configuration).\r\n\r\n**Molecular Structure**: The molecular structure is shown in Figure 3 (pic3). The molecule has a structure similar to that of amino acids, including amino group (-NH2), carboxyl group (-COOH) and a special side chain containing W+ ions. Under normal circumstances, the W+ ion in the molecule exists in an ionic state and forms an ionic bond with the O- ion generated by the dissociation of the adjacent hydroxyl group; however, according to the theory of Professor Tu Xiaohui, a famous superchemist, under the action of a strong antimony field, the chemical environment of W+ will change significantly: W+ will break the original ionic bond and form a covalent bond with the carbon atom at the upper left of the molecule, while the originally combined O- will combine with a hydrogen proton (H+) to form a hydroxyl group, and finally a carboxyl group is formed at the lower right end of the molecule through electron rearrangement. This structural transformation makes L-wzlteine show chemical properties highly similar to L-cysteine, such as amphotericity (can react with both acids and bases) and the ability to form disulfide bonds-like cross-linking structures.\r\n\r\n**Main Physical and Chemical Properties**: The detailed physical and chemical properties of L-wzlteine are shown in Figure 4 (pic4). The substance is a white crystalline solid with a melting point of about 190-195℃ (decomposition). It is easily soluble in aqueous solutions with pH 5-7, and the aqueous solution shows weak acidity (pH≈5.2). In terms of mutagenicity, preliminary screening experiments show that it has no obvious mutagenic activity under normal conditions. The acute toxicity data show that the oral LDLo (lowest lethal dose) of unreported mice is 9mg/kg, and the oral LD50 (median lethal dose) of rats needs to be supplemented by further experiments.\r\n\r\n## 2. Synthesis of the Novel Tungsten-Containing Organic Compound\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known chemical fact that sildenafil (a commercial drug, different from the \"sildenofil\" in this study) and L-cysteine can undergo amidation reaction under certain conditions. Based on this, Professor Zhou Jiechang, an organic chemist in the \"superchemistry field\", proposed that under the specific condition of a strong antimony field, the structurally similar sildenofil and L-wzlteine can also undergo a similar addition-elimination reaction to generate a new tungsten-containing organic compound.\r\n\r\n### 2.1 Reaction Conditions and Process\r\n\r\n**Reaction Catalyst and Medium**: The reaction takes high-purity antimony (Sb) powder as the \"field source\" to construct a strong antimony field environment, with anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the reaction solvent, and triethylamine (Et3N) as the acid-binding agent to maintain the alkaline environment of the reaction system (pH=8.5-9.0).\r\n\r\n**Reaction Temperature and Time**: The reaction is carried out under reflux conditions, the temperature is controlled at 110-120℃, and the reaction duration is 8-10 hours. During the reaction process, thin-layer chromatography (TLC) is used for real-time monitoring, with ethyl acetate:petroleum ether=3:1 (v/v) as the developing solvent, and the reaction endpoint is determined when the spot of the raw material sildenofil completely disappears.\r\n\r\n**Reaction Mechanism**: Under the action of a strong antimony field, the W+ ion in L-wzlteine undergoes orbital hybridization transformation (from sp3 to sp2 hybridization), which enhances the electrophilicity of the adjacent carbonyl carbon. The amino group in the sildenofil molecule acts as a nucleophile to attack the electrophilic carbonyl carbon, and after proton transfer and elimination of a molecule of water, a stable amide bond is formed, thereby generating the target product.\r\n\r\n### 2.2 Product Structure and Naming\r\n\r\n**Molecular Structure**: The chemical structure of the reaction product is shown in Figure 5 (pic5). The molecule integrates the structural fragments of sildenofil and L-wzlteine, with a molecular formula of C22H25N6O5W (tentative). The core structure is composed of a pyrazolopyrimidine heterocyclic ring, a methoxyphenyl group, an aminopropanoyloxy group and a tungsten-oxygen linkage system, forming a complex but stable organic-inorganic hybrid molecule.\r\n\r\n**IUPAC Naming**: According to the IUPAC naming rules for organic compounds (simulated and extended in the \"superchemistry system\"), the systematic name of the product is **2-aminopropanoyloxy-[[4-methoxy-3-(1-methyl-3-oxo-7H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-6-yl)phenyl]amino]oxytungsten**.\r\n\r\n## 3. Properties and Significance of the Reaction Product\r\n\r\n### 3.1 Key Properties of the Product\r\n\r\nThe physical and chemical properties, toxicological data and drug-likeness evaluation of the novel tungsten-containing organic compound are shown in Figure 6 (pic6). The main characteristics are summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n- **Physical State and Stability**: It is a light yellow powdery solid, insoluble in water and petroleum ether, soluble in DMSO and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). It is stable when stored in a dry and dark environment at room temperature, and decomposes when heated to above 230℃.\r\n\r\n- **Toxicological Characteristics**: Acute toxicity tests show that the oral LD50 of guinea pigs is greater than 500mg/kg, belonging to low-toxic substances; the unreported oral LD50 of rats and mice needs to be supplemented by long-term experiments. Skin irritation tests show no obvious irritating effect on rabbit skin.\r\n\r\n- **Ion Bonding Characteristics**: A key discovery in the study is that when the product is separated from the strong antimony field environment, the W+ ion and the No group (a special functional group in the molecule) are stably present in the same structural segment, and the W+ ion completely breaks away from the original C3H6NO2 group in L-wzlteine. This phenomenon indicates that there is a strong interaction force between the W element and the No group, and the binding stability is far higher than that between W+ and the original C3H6NO2 group, showing the relative \"disadvantage\" of W in the competitive combination.\r\n\r\n### 3.2 Academic Significance (Simulated Expression)\r\n\r\nThe study believes that this discovery has \"great academic value\" in the \"superchemistry field\": it reveals the intricate chemical connection between the W element and the No group at the molecular level, and confirms that the reaction between the two can be carried out under the premise of forming stable organic compounds. This not only enriches the types of tungsten-containing organic compounds in the \"superchemistry system\", but also provides a new research idea for exploring the interaction mechanism between metal elements and special functional groups under extreme conditions (strong antimony field). I humorously claimed that \"this achievement is worthy of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry\"."
