# About Us

Nanjing University Intelligent Data Decision Studio (NOVA) was founded in 2017, initially as an academic salon organized by a group of technology enthusiasts. Today, NOVA has evolved into a student club open to all undergraduates, centered on "Problem-Oriented, Cooperation-Accelerated, and Self-Driven" principles. We focus not only on AI technology itself but also on how technology can be reasonably used and practically implemented to solve real-world problems.

## 💡 What We Believe

In this era of rapid knowledge iteration and booming AI development, the core competitiveness of university students lies in problem awareness, self-learning ability, and hands-on practical skills.

Therefore, NOVA always adheres to:

*   **Values as the Bond, Not Entry Thresholds**: We welcome all students willing to learn and share, regardless of their background or major.
*   **Projects as the Carrier, Not Classroom Teaching**: We do not offer lecture-style teaching but build a team to research, work, and create together.
*   **Sharing as the Culture, Not Competitive Involution**: You don't need to "win against others," but rather awaken your inner drive and accelerate evolution through shared collaboration.

## 🛠 What We Do

At NOVA, every member has the opportunity to participate in and lead:

*   🤖 **Frontier Technology Exploration**: LLM QA systems, AI agent research, Generative AI applications.
*   🧶 **Real-World Scenario Applications**: Freshman dormitory allocation, intelligent transformation of administrative workflows, voice synthesis for freshman greetings.
*   📚 **Knowledge Accumulation & Collaboration**: Writing project documentation, forming project groups, holding weekly exchange meetings.
*   🌱 **Cross-Grade Exchange & Sharing**: Breaking information barriers through club activities, broadening horizons to academia and industry.

### Freshman Dormitory Allocation Project
From traditional clustering matching and genetic annealing to evaluation scoring and feature extraction based on AI large models, we have been exploring personalized dormitory allocation schemes, striving for "seeking common ground while reserving differences, and harmony in diversity."

### AI Agent Exploration
We maintain a constant focus on and exploration of large models. The club explores core technologies such as large model tool invocation and agent tool flow construction, deriving application scenarios like agent-based information aggregation and recommendation platforms, intelligent scheduling systems, and reimbursement material recognition systems.

### Generative AI Application Exploration
We actively explore multimodal generative AI and its applications, discovering more possibilities in image generation, voice synthesis, and video generation.

## 🌐 Our Resources & Platforms

*   🧠 **Yuque Knowledge Platform**: Member sharing, project documentation, and study notes are all open for online collaboration.
*   🧮 **Club Technical Resources**: Virtual machines, GPUs, VPNs, and other software/hardware tools are fully available.
*   🤝 **Cross-Campus Linkage Mechanism**: Members from Gulou, Xianlin, and Suzhou campuses can synchronously participate in projects or exchange activities. We regularly hold academic salons and organize alumni to return and share frontier trends in academia and industry.
