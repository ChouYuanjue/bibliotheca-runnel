# About Us

Chaoli Forum (chaoli.club) is an online academic exchange platform established in 2014, originating from the four major academic communities (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology) on Baidu Tieba. Currently, the forum members mainly include undergraduate and graduate students majoring in basic disciplines, middle school students who love science, and enthusiastic young university teachers. The daily visits exceed 20,000.

The forum content focuses on the exchange and discussion of natural science issues, featuring sections such as Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Computer Technology, and Social Sciences. The forum supports features like LaTeX formulas and Markdown notes. With a simple and user-friendly interface, it facilitates daily in-depth mathematical and scientific discussions.
