# About Us

*Original text adapted from a Zhihu article by Keyao Peng.*

## Our Origin & Mission

In the internet age, teenagers with curiosity and passion ("geeks") often seek a sense of belonging. While the internet offers vast information, it can also be a harsh place for young, impressionable minds.

"Geek College" was founded to provide a safe, supportive environment for these teenagers. Our mission is to **"help geek teenagers grow and navigate through adolescence."** We believe that this period is crucial for cultivating academic interests and literacy.

While "geek" might seem like an outdated term, the geek spirit—curiosity and the desire to explore—is timeless. Whether it's mathematics, physics, history, or art, we welcome anyone with a thirst for knowledge, regardless of their age or background.

## What We Do

### 1. Lectures & Sharing
Our main activity is **Lectures**. These are hosted by one or more speakers and feature interaction with the audience. We encourage teenagers to step up and share their knowledge, as teaching is one of the best ways to learn.

### 2. Mentorship & Guidance
We provide consultation on various issues faced during growth, including:
*   **College Major Guide**: Helping choose the right path.
*   **Self-Study Guide**: Learning how to learn.
*   **Reading Recommendations**: Curated lists for curious minds.
*   **Psychological Support**: Navigating the emotional challenges of adolescence.

### 3. Academic Writing
We encourage members to organize their learnings into written forms. We cooperate with **Chaoli Forum** to publish these works, fostering a culture of serious academic discussion.

## Our Structure: The Semester System
To maintain vitality, we operate on a **Semester System**. We recognize that as teenagers grow, their needs change. A "term" lasts about 1 or 2 years, after which members "graduate." We organize graduation activities and encourage graduates to continue participating in the next term as mentors or alumni.

## A Metaphor for Us

> In a cold night, two children lit a bonfire. More and more lost children came to the fire. They felt incredibly happy.
>
> When dawn came, the children slowly found their own paths and left one by one. But they would never forget the bonfire that once gave them warmth.
>
> The bonfire will continue to exist, guiding more children who come after.
