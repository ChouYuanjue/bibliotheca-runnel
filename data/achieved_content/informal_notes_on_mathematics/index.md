# Informal Notes on Mathematics

# Project Description
This is a project for storing notes and materials recorded during the process of self-studying mathematics.

Originally published via FigShare, this project is no longer updated. DOI: [10.6084/m9.figshare.c.6094833.v7](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.6094833.v7)

As of **9:00, September 18, 2025**, the total number of views of this project on FigShare reached **5,899**, with a total download count of **2,345**.

## Project Structure
The project is organized by year and file type, mainly including the following contents:

### Note Files
The naming convention for note files is `N-YYYYMMDD.pdf`, where `YYYYMMDD` denotes the date when the note was created.

### Generated Markdown Files
Note files are converted into Markdown format using the project [ChouYuanjue/PDF_Summary_Tool](https://github.com/ChouYuanjue/PDF_Summary_Tool), with the naming convention `N-YYYYMMDD.md`. Each note corresponds to two Markdown files, automatically generated using different conversion logics. Among them:
- The `md_full-page` folder stores results processed via the full-page conversion method.
- The `md_crop-region` folder stores results processed via the region-cropping method.

(To reduce costs, for notes created after September 2025, the `crop-region` version of Markdown files will no longer be generated if the source files are available.)

### Generated YAML Files
Each Markdown file corresponds to a YAML file named `N-YYYYMMDD.yaml`. The YAML files contain metadata such as content summaries and keywords of the notes, which are also automatically generated using the [ChouYuanjue/PDF_Summary_Tool](https://github.com/ChouYuanjue/PDF_Summary_Tool) project.

### LaTeX Files for Integrated Notes
- `inm.tex` – Main LaTeX source file

Compiling this file generates a PDF document that integrates all notes, including a table of contents.

### Papers
- `papers/` – A collection of papers written to practice TeX. These are mainly for entertainment and meme purposes, and do not hold practical scientific significance.

### Auxiliary Tools
- `list.py` – A Python script that automatically generates a list of PDF files
- `commits.py` – An auxiliary script related to Git commits

## Project Objectives
This project aims to:
1. Systematically record thoughts, derivations and understandings during the process of self-studying mathematics
2. Organize and archive mathematics learning materials for easy review and retrieval
3. Provide a structured method to track the progress of mathematics learning
4. Experiment with the digitization of study notes

## Usage Instructions

### Viewing Individual Notes
1. Navigate to the corresponding year folder (e.g., `2022/`)
2. Directly open the file named in the format `N-YYYYMMDD.pdf` to view the notes created on the specified date

### Generating a Complete Collection of Notes
1. Ensure that a Python environment is installed
2. Run the script `python list.py` to automatically generate an updated list of notes
3. Compile the `inm.tex` file using a LaTeX compiler (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX)
4. Obtain a complete PDF document containing all notes and a table of contents

### Viewing Digitized Notes
1. Navigate to the `md_full-page/` or `md_crop-region/` folder
2. Open the corresponding Markdown file to view the digitized version of the notes
3. Each PDF note corresponds to two Markdown files generated by different conversion logics

### Viewing Metadata Information
1. Locate the YAML file with the same name as the PDF in each year folder
2. Open the YAML file to view metadata such as the content summary and keywords of the notes
