    "description": "This document explores matrix calculus and tensor \"collapse\" in the context of neural network backpropagation. It demonstrates that while the gradient ∂y/∂W for a linear layer z = Wx + b is theoretically a 3D tensor (m×m×n), it collapses into a simple outer product ∂y/∂W = (∂y/∂z)xᵀ due to sparsity from element-wise activation functions and the chain rule. Two rigorous proofs are provided: one using Einstein summation convention with Kronecker delta to handle indices component-wise, and another employing vectorization and Kronecker products for formal matrix-level derivation. Both methods confirm the same efficient gradient computation, avoiding explicit storage of the high-dimensional tensor.",

Euler's formula (V - E + F = 2) is derived via induction and applied to classify regular polyhedra, showing only five exist. The topology section defines the degree of maps between spheres via homology groups and introduces quotient groups, normal subgroups, and coset multiplication, linking to modular arithmetic like Z/nZ.

Type theory, rooted in constructive and computational principles, connects logic and programming via the Curry-Howard correspondence.

    "description": "This document provides an informal overview of nonstandard analysis (NSA), introduced by Abraham Robinson, which extends standard analysis by incorporating infinitesimals and infinite numbers through the hyperreal number system *R, constructed via ultrafilters and ultraproducts. Key concepts include the transfer principle, which ensures first-order logical statements hold in both standard and nonstandard systems, and definitions of continuity, derivatives, and integrals using infinitesimals for more intuitive proofs. NSA distinguishes internal and external sets and applies to probability via Loeb measures. While NSA offers intuitive and sometimes simpler proofs, it relies on model theory and set theory foundations, maintaining logical equivalence with standard analysis but with trade-offs in accessibility and application scope.",

The notes also review multiple-angle formulas and recurrence relations for sin(nx), cos(nx), and tan(nx). Finally, it proves that the determinant of a specific tridiagonal n×n matrix with 2cosθ on the diagonal and 1s on the sub- and super-diagonals equals cos(nθ), using a recurrence relation and induction.",

Numerical simulations using the Runge-Kutta method demonstrate orbital dynamics around a cubic planet, revealing precession and distortion due to non-uniform gravitational fields. The conclusion emphasizes that only spherical masses can be treated as point masses, while others require integration methods, with Cartesian coordinates being more practical than spherical ones for non-spherical cases.",

Initially, it proves that x^(2n)+x^n+1 has factor x^2+x+1 if and only if n is not divisible by 3, using primitive roots and direct factorization. The study then generalizes to polynomials ∑x^(in) for k≥2, disproving the initial conjecture that ∑x^i divides ∑x^(in) when n is not divisible by (k+1). Using MATLAB for visualization and complex analysis, it demonstrates that when n is not divisible by (k+1), these polynomials share common real-coefficient factors P(x), with roots expressed exponentially showing periodic argument distributions. The conclusion highlights the value of employing multiple methods, including computational tools, to address complex mathematical problems.",

In homotopy, it introduces path homotopy as continuous deformation between paths with fixed endpoints, defines simply connected spaces where all paths are homotopic, and uses examples like C and C\\{0} to illustrate these concepts. In algebra, it defines semigroups, monoids, and groups with their properties, provides propositions characterizing groups, and gives examples including integers under addition and symmetric groups. It also covers homomorphisms, defining various types (mono-, epi-, iso-, endo-, auto-morphisms) and their compositions, with examples like canonical epimorphisms from Z to Zm.

Key topics include continuity defined via pre-images of open sets, homeomorphisms as bijections preserving open sets, and closed sets with closures. It highlights limitations: completeness and boundedness are metric-specific and not topological, sequences behave poorly, and non-metrizable spaces exist. Separation axioms are introduced, emphasizing Hausdorff spaces where distinct points have disjoint neighborhoods. Subspace topology is defined via intersections. Connectedness is characterized by absence of nontrivial clopen sets, with examples of disconnected (e.g., discrete spaces, rationals) and connected sets (e.g., intervals). Path-connectedness, a stronger notion, requires continuous paths between points and implies connectedness, with examples like R² and S¹. Conclusions note that while many metric ideas generalize, some properties are inherently metric-dependent.",

Examples illustrate homeomorphisms (e.g., torus to coffee cup, (-1,1) to R) and non-homeomorphic continuous bijections. The open set condition for continuity is stated and partially proven.

It contrasts this with dissection congruence in polygons (resolved by the Wallace-Bolyai-Gerwein theorem) and polyhedra (addressed via Dehn invariants). The Banach-Tarski paradox and measure theory implications are noted, particularly differences between dimensions. Laczkovich's 1990 affirmative solution is highlighted: using the axiom of choice, he proved that bounded sets in R^k with equal positive Lebesgue measure and boundaries of upper Minkowski dimension less than k are equidecomposable. His approach involves translations on the torus, graph theory, and a refined ergodic theorem leveraging Diophantine approximation to ensure nearly uniform distribution of set elements in orbits.",

    "description": "This document provides an introduction to elliptic curves (ECs), defined by equations of the form y² = x³ + ax + b, emphasizing that valid ECs must avoid double or triple roots, ensured by the condition 4a³ + 27b² ≠ 0. It outlines proofs for this criterion and introduces elliptic curve arithmetic, defining a group operation via geometric point addition: for distinct points, the sum is found by drawing a line through them, finding its third intersection with the curve, and reflecting across the x-axis, with formulas derived using slopes and Vieta’s theorem. Point doubling (adding a point to itself) uses tangent slopes from implicit differentiation. The summary includes handling the special case of vertical lines by introducing a point at infinity (∞) to ensure closure, making ECs suitable for cryptographic applications like group-based cryptosystems.",

Second, it proves that for the alternating harmonic series up to 1/1319 expressed as p/q in lowest terms, p is divisible by the prime number 1979 by regrouping terms into pairs whose numerators are multiples of 1979 and leveraging coprimality. Both proofs utilize algebraic manipulation, properties of divisibility, and number theory concepts.",

    "description": "This document presents informal mathematical notes covering probability theory and algebraic substitutions. It begins by defining fundamental probability concepts such as random experiments, sample spaces, events, classical probability (with an example calculating the probability of keys not matching locks), geometric probability, conditional probability, and independence. The second part focuses on algebraic substitutions for solving inequalities under constraints like abc=1, introducing transformations such as x=a+1/a and deriving relations like x²+y²+z²−xyz=4. Applications include proving classical inequalities (e.g., Nesbitt's inequality) and solving problems involving acute triangles and polynomials, demonstrating that polynomials vanishing under specific substitutions must be divisible by x²+y²+z²−xyz−4. Key findings emphasize the utility of substitutions in simplifying and solving algebraic and probabilistic problems.",

    "description": "This document provides informal notes on matrix inverses and rotation matrices in linear algebra. Key points include: a matrix is invertible if and only if it has n pivots or a non-zero determinant, with uniqueness of the inverse and solutions to Ax=b and Ax=0 highlighted. Specific formulas for 2x2 and diagonal matrix inverses are given, alongside properties like (AB)⁻¹=B⁻¹A⁻¹. Two methods for computing inverses are discussed: the adjugate matrix approach (A⁻¹=1/|A| A*) and Gaussian elimination. The notes also cover rotation matrices, deriving Rθ for planar rotations about the origin using basis vectors and linear combinations, and clarify that rotations about arbitrary points are not linear transformations. Overall, the document summarizes fundamental concepts and computational techniques for matrix inverses and rotations.",

ETCS uses functions as a primitive concept, defining elements as functions from a terminal set, and includes ten axioms covering composition, terminal and empty sets, Cartesian products, function sets, inverse images, subset classifiers, natural numbers, and the axiom of choice. It argues that ETCS aligns better with mathematicians' intuitive use of sets, avoids ZFC's issues (like requiring all elements to be sets), and is equally expressive when augmented with an eleventh axiom (replacement). The approach is elementary, avoiding advanced category theory, and aims to provide a more natural foundation for most mathematical practice.",

    "description": "This document covers foundational concepts in set theory, including the Axiom of Choice and its equivalence to the existence of choice functions, definitions of partially and totally ordered sets, Zorn's Lemma, and the Well Ordering Principle. It introduces cardinal numbers, equipollence, and finite/infinite sets, proving key results such as Cantor's theorem (|A| < |P(A)|), the Schröder-Bernstein theorem, trichotomy for cardinals, and properties of infinite sets (e.g., every infinite set has a denumerable subset, and for infinite cardinals α and β with β ≤ α, α + β = α and αβ = α). It concludes with corollaries on the cardinality of finite subsets of infinite sets.",

    "description": "This document presents foundational concepts in set theory and functions, covering definitions of sets, proper classes (illustrated by Russell's Paradox), power sets, indexed families with unions and intersections, and relative complements. It details properties of sets including DeMorgan's Laws, defines functions with images and inverse images, and characterizes injective, surjective, and bijective functions. Key theorems establish relationships between function composition and injectivity/surjectivity, and Theorem 1.0.10 shows that a bijective function has a two-sided inverse, contingent on the Axiom of Choice. The content serves as an introductory framework for mathematical structures and mappings.",
