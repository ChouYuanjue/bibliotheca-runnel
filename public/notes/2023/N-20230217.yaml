summary: 'This document provides informal notes on  mathematics, focusing on
   representations in Cartesian bases, reciprocal bases, and component calculations.
  Key topics include: expressing s using dyadic bases in 2D and 3D; defining
  reciprocal basis vectors via matrix inversion and Kronecker delta; distinguishing
  roof (contravariant) and cellar (covariant) components; solving problems to compute
  reciprocal vectors and components; and introducing the permutation  Eijk for
  cross products, with properties based on Jacobian determinants and parity of index
  permutations. The notes emphasize practical computations and illustrate  operations
  in general bases.'
